// DEFAULT TREE RULES PROMPT
// =============================================================================

var DEFAULT_TREE_RULES = `You are a Skyrim spell tree architect. Create a logical learning progression tree for each school of magic.

## CRITICAL RULES (MUST FOLLOW)

### 1. SCHOOL SEPARATION (MOST IMPORTANT!)
- **NEVER mix spells between schools!**
- Each spell has a "school" field - ONLY place spells in their OWN school's tree
- Example: Clairvoyance has "school": "Illusion" → it goes in Illusion tree, NOT Alteration
- VALIDATE every spell belongs to the correct school before adding

### 2. INCLUDE ALL SPELLS
- Every spell from the input MUST appear in the output
- Count spells per school and verify your output matches

### 3. MAXIMUM 3 BRANCHES PER NODE
- Each spell can have AT MOST 3 children
- If more connections needed, create intermediate nodes or chains
- This keeps the tree visually clean and navigable

### 4. SAME-TIER BRANCHING ALLOWED
- Novice spells CAN branch to other Novice spells
- Progression does NOT require increasing skill level
- Group by THEME/EFFECT, not just skill tier
- Example: Flames (Novice) → Frostbite (Novice) → Sparks (Novice) is VALID if thematically grouped

### 5. PREFER VANILLA FORMIDS FOR ROOTS
- FormIDs starting with 0x00 are vanilla (preferred for roots)
- 0x02 = Dawnguard, 0x04 = Dragonborn, 0xFE+ = mods
- Recommended vanilla roots:
  - Destruction: Flames (0x00012FCD)
  - Restoration: Healing (0x00012FCC)
  - Alteration: Oakflesh (0x0005AD5C) or Candlelight (0x00043324)
  - Conjuration: Conjure Familiar (0x000640B6)
  - Illusion: Clairvoyance (0x00021143) or Courage (0x0004DEE8)

## Tree Structure Rules

1. **One Root Per School**: Each school has exactly ONE root spell - a Novice-level spell FROM THAT SCHOOL.

2. **Branching Logic** (max 3 children per node):
   - Destruction: Branch by element (Fire, Frost, Shock)
   - Conjuration: Branch by summon type (Atronachs, Undead, Daedra) and bound weapons
   - Illusion: Branch by effect type (Fear, Calm, Frenzy, Invisibility, Muffle)
   - Alteration: Branch by effect (Armor, Paralysis, Light, Transmute, Detect)
   - Restoration: Branch by effect (Healing, Turn Undead, Wards)

3. **Tier Progression**: 
   - Branching within same tier is encouraged (Novice→Novice for variety)
   - Higher tier spells should generally require SOME lower tier prereqs
   - Master spells need Expert prereqs, Expert needs Adept, etc.

4. **Prerequisites**: Only from same school, thematically sensible.

## BEFORE OUTPUT - VALIDATE:
- [ ] Every node's school matches the tree it's in
- [ ] All input spells appear in output
- [ ] Each school has exactly one root
- [ ] No node has more than 3 children
- [ ] No duplicate formIds across trees
